        <a href="">Choosing the right ammunition</a></h2>
        <p><h2>  
        &sdot;Selecting the right type of bullet is crucial for effective shooting.
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;Different bullets serve various purposes, from self-defense to hunting and target shooting.
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;Understanding the characteristics of each bullet type helps in making informed decisions.
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;This guide covers common bullet types and their applications.
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;Target practice and training: FMJ and frangible rounds are often preferred.
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;Self-defense: Hollow point rounds are often recommended due to their expansion and stopping power.  
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;Hunting: Soft point or ballistic tip rounds are popular choices for hunting different types of game.
            <br />
            <br />
        &sdot;Tactical and military applications: Armor-piercing rounds may be used when permitted.

        <a href="">Frangible Bullets</a></h2>
        <p><h2>
            Frangible bullets are designed to disintegrate upon impact with hard surfaces.
            <br />
            <br />
            Reducing the risk of ricochet.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are often used in training environments and for shooting at steel targets.
            <br />
            <br />
            Made from compressed metal powders.
            <br />
            <br />
            They minimize the risk of injury from stray bullets.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ideal for close-quarter training and tactical scenarios.

        <a href="">Soft Point (SP)</a></h2>
        <p><h2>
            Soft Point bullets have a lead core with a soft tip that expands upon impact.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are designed for hunting, providing good stopping power while minimizing over-penetration.
            <br />
            <br />
            The exposed lead tip allows for controlled expansion, making them effective against game animals.
            <br />
            <br />
            Similar to hollow points, soft points offer controlled expansion.
            <br />
            <br />
            Balancing penetration and stopping power.

        <p><h2>
            AP bullets are designed to penetrate hard targets like armor plating.
            <br />
            <br />
            They often have a hardened steel or tungsten core 
            <br />
            <br />
            Trictly regulated or prohibited in many jurisdictions due to their high penetration capabilities.

        <p><h2>
            Tracer bullets have a small pyrotechnic charge that ignites upon firing, leaving a visible trail.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are used to help shooters see the trajectory of their shots, especially in low-light conditions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tracers can also be used for signaling or marking targets.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, they can also reveal the shooter's position.

        <p><h2>
            Hollow Point bullets are designed to expand upon impact, creating a larger wound channel.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are often used for self-defense and hunting due to their stopping power.
            <br />
            <br />
            The expansion reduces the risk of over-penetration, making them safer in populated areas.

        <h2><a href="calibers.html">Subsonic ammunition</a></h2>
        <p><h2>
            Subsonic ammunition is designed to travel at speeds below the speed of sound, reducing noise when fired.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is often used with suppressors for stealthy shooting.
            <br />
            <br />
            Subsonic rounds are typically heavier and slower than standard ammunition.
            <br />
            <br />
            They are popular in tactical and hunting applications where noise reduction is essential.
            <br />
            <br />
            Subsonic ammunition is commonly used in .22 LR and some pistol calibers.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is important to ensure that the firearm is compatible with subsonic rounds for reliable cycling and performance.
